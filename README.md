# A Simple Web Browser in Go

A naive attempt at building a simple web browser in Go. The code is really basic and only covers 5% of the actual effort needed to build browser - no GUI. However, it's a good foundation for anyone interested in learning this stuff. For further reading, Google has an excellent web series on [how modern browsers work](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/inside-browser-part1/).
